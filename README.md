I won't mind if you take some code to learn or improve but please don't be a skid.
Feel free to ask me questions, NotSoSuper#8880 on Discord.

Also, remember to set `discord_path`, `files_path` and `bot_key` enviormentals in your `/etc/enviormentals` if you want it to work, final thing might be tricky but you can always reverse it, is the MySQL database tables and schemes.
